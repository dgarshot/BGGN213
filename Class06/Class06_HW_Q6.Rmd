## Question 6

# New and improved analysis code!

```{r}
library(bio3d)
# Read a protein PDB file from the RCSB online database
protein <- function(x) {
  # protein stuc pdb read into
  p_ID <- read.pdb(x) 
  # Trim PDB to specific chain and atom type
  protein_trim <- trim.pdb(p_ID, chain="A", elety="CA")
  # Select column b from row **atom** in data.frame
  p_atom <- protein_trim$atom$b
  plotb3(p_atom, sse=p_atom, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")
}
protein("4AKE")
protein("1AKE")
protein("1E4Y")

# Output is a plot of protein B-factor (displacement of the atomic position from an average value) at a given residue within the protein structure. 
```
